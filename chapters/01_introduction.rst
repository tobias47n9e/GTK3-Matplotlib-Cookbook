This Cookbook explains how to embed Matplotlib into GTK3 using Python 3. The tutorials will start out simple, and slowly increase in difficulty. The examples will focus on education and application of mathematics and science. The goal is to make the reader a independent developer of scientific applications that process and graph data.

If you would like to add your own examples to this tutorial, please create an issue or pull request at the github repository.

Requirements
------------
To follow the examples you should have access to GTK+ 3.x, Python 3.x and Glade 3.16.x or a more recent version.

Recommended reading
-------------------
In order to follow along with the Cookbook it is recommended to go through a Python 3.x tutorial (e.g. `https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/ <https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/>`_) and a tutorial about the Python bindings of GTK 3.x (e.g. http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/).

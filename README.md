GTK3-Matplotlib-Cookbook
========================
This cookbook introduces the reader to the development of graphical user interfaces with plots for science teaching and research. The programs are written in Python 3 and the user interface is build using the Python3-bindings for GTK+ 3.x (PyGObject), and the layout is done both within the code and using a graphical user-interface builder (Glade). The plots are made using Matplotlib.

##News and Comments
###2014-07-26
The fourth chapter about entering data is finished. I also decided to start code reviewing with Landscape. The score was 63 % on standard settings and 23 % on high (meaning very strict code reviewing). The low score is mostly caused by the *conf.py* file from Sphinx, my usage of "old classes" and Landscape complaining about the Gtk specific code. I will try to deal with the issues first, before uploading more chapters.

Third chapter about zooming closer to datapoints is done. Currently I am just adding examples when I'm pleased with them. I will reorganize the book once the content is done. The new example relies heavily on classes. Does anybody reading this think that the amount of explanation is sufficient?

###2014-06-19
This Cookbook is not finished and will be gradually developed in the coming months. If you would like to participate you can mail me or fork the repository. I am a beginning programmer, so the presented code might not be optimal. If you find any sub-optimal sections please write me, or create an issue or pull request on Github.
